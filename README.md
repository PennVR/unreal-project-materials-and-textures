### Game Mechanics
There is one central tower in the game which serves as home base. The players spawn on pillars which circle the tower and have to protect the tower from Goomba Attacks. Goombas have spawn points throughout the level and travel inwards towards the center of the map. When a Goomba reaches the tower, it explodes and inflicts some amount of damage on the tower.  

* Arrow Mechanics
There are two types of arrows in the game, teleportation arrows and damage arrows. 
    * Teleportation Arrows (Silver) allow you to travel anywhere on map within the bounds of the playing field. You use these to get around. 
    * Damage Arrows (Gold) are used to destroy the Goombas attacking your tower.

### How to play

* Arrows
   1. Nock your arrow. Bring your bow and arrow together in front of you and hold down the arrow trigger.
   2. Charge your bow by pulling back with your arrow hand. The brighter the bow glows, the more force applied to the arrow.
   3. Fire by releasing the arrow trigger.
   4. Reload a new arrow by pressing the grip while reaching over your shoulder.
   5. Toggle between damage (gold) and teleport (silver) arrows by pressing the bow trigger.
   
* Castle
Your castle stars with 100 health points and decreases by 5 everytime a goomba explodes within it. When the health of the castle gets down to 0, the game is over.

* Multiplayer
One player creates a new game and other players search for games within the lobby. When joining a game, the two or more players will spawn at different locations and now have a joint mission to protect their castle at all costs.

### VR Mode
In our testing we have not felt motion sickness while playing the game. We believe the primary reason for this is due to the fading that we employ during teleportation. There is no other significant movement during the game.

### Hardest Part of the Assignment
Our team spent a lot of time working on getting multiplayer support for our game. The hardest part was making sure that the replication carried across client to server and did not affect game play in single player mode. In a similar vein, we spent a lot of time working on figuring out how to get teleportation to work on the client games.

### What do we wish we had done differently?

* One of the biggest thing we would change is to make the AI more intelligent in the game. Currently all the goombas spawn in the same locations around the map and then converge on the same point. In fact, thereâ€™s a funny bug which can occur if the goombas all converge in the castle at the same time. Instead we could have randomly spawned the goombas in various locations, with various speeds and targets.

* We could have also changed the way we displayed castle health. Currently it is on top of the castle which means that you cannot monitor health while inside the castle. Instead we could have had the display on the character some how.

* Other extensions we would have liked to have had the time to implement were multiple arrow types and different damage level goombas.
